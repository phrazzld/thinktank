# T001 Plan: Define canonical LLMError struct

## Overview
This task involves creating a canonical error structure for the LLM processing system to standardize error handling across different providers (OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter).

## Analysis
After examining the current codebase, I've found that the canonical `LLMError` struct has already been implemented in `/Users/phaedrus/Development/thinktank/internal/llm/errors.go`. The implementation meets all the requirements specified in the task:

1. The `LLMError` struct is defined with the required fields:
   - `Provider` (string)
   - `Code` (string)
   - `StatusCode` (int)
   - `Message` (string)
   - `Original` (error) - this is the field for the original error
   - `ErrorCategory` (enum)
   - `Suggestion` (string)
   - `Details` (string)
   - Plus an additional `RequestID` field that wasn't in the requirements

2. The standard `error` interface is implemented with the `Error() string` method

3. The `Unwrap() error` method is implemented to return the original error

4. The `CategorizedError` interface is defined and implemented by `LLMError`

5. Comprehensive tests are already in place in `errors_test.go` and `errors_coverage_test.go`

Additionally, the implementation includes several helper methods and functions:
- `UserFacingError()` method for user-friendly error messages
- `DebugInfo()` method for detailed debugging information
- `New()` function for creating a new error
- `Wrap()` function for wrapping an existing error
- `IsCategory()` and other category-specific functions for error checking
- Functions for detecting error categories from HTTP status codes and messages

## Conclusion
This task is already completed, as all the requirements have been met by the existing implementation. The `LLMError` struct is defined with all the required fields, implements the standard error interface, and provides the necessary unwrapping functionality.

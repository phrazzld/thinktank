# T030-1: Test Fixes for OutputWriter Interface Changes

## Problem

Implementation of task T029 (Improved results summary output) involved changes to the OutputWriter interface to support the new summary feature. These changes broke existing tests:

1. `SaveIndividualOutputs` now returns 3 values (count, paths map, error) instead of 2 (count, error)
2. `SaveSynthesisOutput` now returns 2 values (path, error) instead of 1 (error)
3. Test mocks don't implement the updated interface correctly
4. The SimpleTestLogger is missing required methods (Fatal, FatalContext)

## Solution

1. Created a base implementation for mock output writers (`BaseMockOutputWriter`)
2. Updated the mock implementations in test files to match the new interfaces
3. Added missing methods to SimpleTestLogger
4. Created a legacy adapter for backward compatibility with tests

## Files Changed

- `/internal/thinktank/orchestrator/output_writer.go`: Added legacy adapter
- `/internal/thinktank/orchestrator/output_writer_mock.go`: New file with base mock impl
- `/internal/thinktank/orchestrator/orchestrator_individual_output_test.go`: Updated mocks
- `/internal/thinktank/orchestrator/orchestrator_synthesis_test.go`: Updated mocks
- `/internal/thinktank/orchestrator/summary_writer_test.go`: Fixed logger implementation

This is part 1 of T030, focused on fixing the tests to work with the interface changes from T029. The second part will add more comprehensive tests for the new functionality.

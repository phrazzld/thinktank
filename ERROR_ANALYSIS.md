# Error Analysis and Resolution Plan

## Issues Discovered

After implementing T028 (adding tolerant mode flag and exit code logic), we encountered several build and test errors. This document outlines these issues and proposes a resolution plan.

### 1. Duplicate Declarations

Multiple files contain duplicate declarations due to the presence of both original and refactored versions:

```
internal/auditlog/entry_refactored.go:7:6: AuditEntry redeclared in this block
internal/auditlog/entry.go:7:6: other declaration of AuditEntry
```

**Affected files**:
- `internal/auditlog/entry_refactored.go` vs. `internal/auditlog/entry.go`
- `internal/auditlog/logger_refactored.go` vs. `internal/auditlog/logger.go`
- `internal/thinktank/orchestrator/errors_refactored.go` vs. `internal/thinktank/orchestrator/errors.go`
- Multiple other refactored files

### 2. Import Errors

```
cannot find module providing package github.com/phrazzld/thinktank/internal/interfaces: import lookup disabled by -mod=vendor
```

These errors appear to be due to changes in import paths or package reorganization in the refactored files.

### 3. Unused Imports

Some test files have unused imports which trigger linter errors.

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on the file listings and error messages, it appears that we have created refactored versions of files as part of our implementation without properly handling the original files. This has resulted in:

1. Duplicate declarations when both the original and refactored versions are compiled together
2. Import errors due to inconsistent package paths between the original and refactored code
3. Issues with the vendor directory configuration

## Resolution Approach

### Immediate Fixes (Required for T028)

1. **Remove All Refactored Files**:
   - Since these files aren't part of the original codebase, they should be removed to prevent duplicate declarations.
   - This includes all files with `*_refactored*` in the name.

2. **Fix Implementation to Work With Original Files**:
   - Update our T028 implementation to properly work with the original codebase structure.
   - Ensure imports use the correct package paths.

3. **Clean Up Test Files**:
   - Ensure all test files have the correct imports and no unused packages.

### Additional Tasks to Create in TODO.md

We need to add specific tasks for comprehensive error handling and refactoring work:

1. **T032 · Cleanup · P0: Remove refactored duplicate files**
   - Remove all *_refactored* files to prevent duplicate declarations
   - Ensure proper merging of any needed changes from refactored files

2. **T033 · Refactor · P1: Fix import paths and package structure**
   - Resolve issues with import paths for internal packages
   - Ensure vendor directory is properly configured
   - Fix circular dependencies if present

3. **T034 · Refactor · P1: Update tests for error handling improvements**
   - Create proper tests for all error handling components
   - Ensure tests don't create import errors or compilation issues

## Implementation Plan for Current Task (T028)

1. Revert any unintended changes to refactored files
2. Update our implementation to work solely with the original files
3. Complete comprehensive tests for our specific changes without impacting other components
4. Add the detailed tasks to TODO.md for future cleanup

This approach will ensure we can complete T028 successfully while properly addressing the underlying issues in the codebase.

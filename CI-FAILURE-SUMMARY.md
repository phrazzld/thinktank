# CI Failure Summary - Updated

## Build Information
- **PR:** #24 - "feat: implement automated semantic versioning"
- **Branch:** feature/automated-semantic-versioning
- **Trigger:** pull_request
- **Run ID:** 15149138251
- **Failing Job:** Lint, Test & Build Check
- **Failing Step:** Validate Commit Messages (baseline-aware)

## Error Details

The CI pipeline is failing at the commit message validation step with multiple issues:

1. **Invalid Configuration:**
   ```
   Unexpected input(s) 'fromRef', valid inputs are ['entryPoint', 'args', 'configFile', 'failOnWarnings', 'failOnErrors', 'helpURL', 'commitDepth', 'token']
   ```

2. **Invalid Commit Messages:**
   ```
   ⧗   input: This is an invalid commit message without type prefix
   ✖   subject may not be empty [subject-empty]
   ✖   type may not be empty [type-empty]
   ```

   ```
   ⧗   input: docs: add PR #24 incident details to ci-troubleshooting guide
   ⚠   footer must have leading blank line [footer-leading-blank]
   ```

   ```
   ⧗   input: feat(ci): update commit validation to use baseline commit
   ✖   body's lines must not be longer than 100 characters [body-max-line-length]
   ```

## Affected Components
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Commit validation configuration
- `commitlint-github-action` configuration - Usage of unsupported `fromRef` parameter

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Primary Issue: Incompatible Parameter in GitHub Action**
   - The CI is configured to use `wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v5` with a `fromRef` parameter
   - This parameter is not supported by this version of the action
   - The intended functionality was to only validate commits made after baseline commit `1300e4d`

2. **Secondary Issue: Invalid Commit Messages in History**
   - PR contains commits that don't follow the conventional commits standard
   - Some commits predate the baseline commit (May 18, 2025) when the standard was adopted
   - The PR includes at least one commit with no type prefix and others with formatting issues

3. **Implementation Conflict: Baseline Validation Approach**
   - Current CI configuration attempts to implement baseline validation
   - The chosen method (`fromRef` parameter) is not supported by the action
   - This creates a situation where historical commits fail validation but shouldn't

## Impact
- PR #24 cannot be merged until CI passes
- Current implementation of baseline validation is not working
- The CI fails to properly implement the intended policy of only validating commits after baseline

## Previous Resolution Attempts

The project has already implemented several tasks to address commit validation issues:

1. **Adding Baseline Validation (T049)**
   - Updated CI workflow to only validate commits after baseline commit `1300e4d`
   - Implemented to preserve git history while ensuring new commits follow conventions

2. **CI Workflow Enhancements (T054)**
   - Enhanced error messages to explicitly reference baseline validation policy
   - Added documentation about baseline approach
   - Improved clarity of error outputs

3. **Commit Standards Documentation (T056)**
   - Created comprehensive conventional commits reference guide
   - Added quick reference examples and baseline documentation
   - Documentation includes clear instructions for fixing invalid commits

Despite these efforts, the current implementation using the `fromRef` parameter is causing configuration errors.

## Recommended Resolution Path

1. **Fix GitHub Action Configuration**
   - Remove the unsupported `fromRef` parameter
   - Implement a supported method for baseline validation
   - Add clear documentation in the workflow file

2. **Improve Error Messages**
   - Update error messages to clearly explain the baseline validation policy
   - Provide actionable guidance for contributors on resolving commit message issues

3. **Fix Commit Message Formatting**
   - Address the specific formatting issues in the recent commits
   - Ensure commit body lines are under 100 characters in length
   - Add required blank line before commit footers

4. **Document Approach**
   - Update documentation to explain the baseline validation approach
   - Include information about the technical limitations encountered

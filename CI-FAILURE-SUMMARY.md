# CI Failure Summary for PR #24

## Overview
PR #24 "feat: implement automated semantic versioning and release workflow" is currently failing CI checks due to an issue with the commit message validation implementation.

## Primary Issues

### 1. Commit Message Validation Errors
* The baseline validation script (`scripts/ci/validate-baseline-commits.sh`) is checking commits after the baseline date but applying validation incorrectly
* The implementation is inconsistent: it properly identifies post-baseline commits but doesn't properly exempt pre-baseline commits
* All 26 commits in the PR are being flagged as invalid, despite the intention to only validate new commits

### 2. Improper Baseline Implementation
* The baseline approach is conceptually correct but has implementation flaws
* The current script is trying to validate all commits after the baseline (May 18, 2025) rather than only validating commits that are made from this point forward
* This creates an impossible situation where historical commits (which can't be changed without rewriting history) are being validated against a standard adopted later

## Solution Direction
The correct implementation should:
1. Preserve git history (no rebasing or squashing)
2. Only enforce conventional commit format for NEW commits moving forward
3. Leave historical commits untouched but still included in the PR
4. Update validation script to work correctly with the baseline approach
5. Fix CI configuration to properly implement this policy

This aligns with the user's requirement: "we do not fucking want to rebase. we do not believe in rewriting history. whatever our fix, it should preserve history"

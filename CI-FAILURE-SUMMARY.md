# CI Failure Summary

## Build Information
- PR: #24 "feat: implement automated semantic versioning and release workflow"
- Failing Job: "Lint, Test & Build Check" in the "CI and Release" workflow
- Status: FAILURE

## Error Logs
The CI failure is due to insufficient code coverage. The CI workflow requires 90% test coverage, but the current coverage is only 71.9%.

```
Total code coverage: 71.9%
‚ùå Coverage check failed (71.9% < 90%)
```

## Affected Components
The `check-coverage.sh` script runs against all packages and requires a minimum coverage threshold of 90% in the release workflow.

## Additional Context
The CI and Go CI workflows have different coverage thresholds:
- CI and Release workflow: 90% threshold
- Go CI workflow: 64% threshold (temporarily lowered from 75%, with a target of 90%)

This discrepancy is causing the build to fail in the CI and Release workflow while potentially passing in the Go CI workflow.

## Key Findings
1. The release workflow uses a higher threshold (90%) than the CI workflow (64%)
2. Package-specific thresholds are defined but not used in the release workflow
3. The project is working towards improving test coverage but has not reached the target level yet

## Root Cause
There's a mismatch between the coverage thresholds in the CI and Release workflows. While the Go CI workflow has temporarily lowered thresholds to accommodate ongoing test development, the Release workflow still enforces the target threshold of 90%.

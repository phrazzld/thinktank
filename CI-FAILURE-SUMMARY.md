# CI Failure Summary

## Overview
- **PR Number:** #24
- **PR Title:** feat: implement automated semantic versioning and release workflow
- **PR URL:** [PR #24](https://github.com/phrazzld/thinktank/pull/24)
- **Branch:** feature/automated-semantic-versioning
- **Failed Run ID:** 15137810387
- **Failed Job:** Lint, Test & Build Check
- **Failed Step:** Validate Commit Messages

## Error Details

The CI pipeline failed at the commit message validation step with the following errors:

1. Invalid commit message detected:
   ```
   ⧗   input: This is an invalid commit message without type prefix
   ✖   subject may not be empty [subject-empty]
   ✖   type may not be empty [type-empty]
   ```

2. Commit with warning:
   ```
   ⧗   input: docs: add PR #24 incident details to ci-troubleshooting guide
   ⚠   footer must have leading blank line [footer-leading-blank]
   ```

## Pipeline Execution

The "CI and Release" workflow failed during the "Validate Commit Messages" step. The validation is performed by the `wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v5` GitHub Action, which checks commit messages against the rules defined in `.commitlintrc.yml`.

- The "Lint, Test & Build Check" job failed
- The "Create Release" job was skipped due to the previous job failure (as expected with fail-fast configuration)

## Observed Issues

1. **Invalid Commit Message:** One of the commits in the history doesn't follow the Conventional Commits format. It's missing a type prefix entirely ("feat:", "fix:", etc.).

2. **Footer Format Warning:** The most recent commit (docs: add PR #24 incident details...) has a warning about the commit footer. The commit body and footer should be separated by a blank line.

## Relevant Files

The following files are related to the failure:

1. `.commitlintrc.yml` - Contains the Conventional Commits validation rules
2. `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Contains the CI workflow configuration

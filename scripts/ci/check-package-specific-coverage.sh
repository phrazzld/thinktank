# check-package-specific-coverage.sh - Check coverage for specific packages against individualized thresholds
# Usage: scripts/ci/check-package-specific-coverage.sh
#
# This script checks test coverage for specific packages against individualized thresholds.
# It allows setting different coverage requirements for different packages based on
# their current state and importance. This is useful during a transition period when
# some packages have lower coverage that's being gradually improved.
#
# Package thresholds are defined in this script and documented in coverage-analysis.md.
# The CI workflow enforces these thresholds by running this script.

# Define the overall threshold with gradual rollout support

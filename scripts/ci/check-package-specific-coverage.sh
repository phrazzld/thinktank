# check-package-specific-coverage.sh - Check coverage for specific packages against individualized thresholds
# Usage: scripts/ci/check-package-specific-coverage.sh
#
# This script checks test coverage for specific packages against individualized thresholds.
# It allows setting different coverage requirements for different packages based on
# their current state and importance. This is useful during a transition period when
# some packages have lower coverage that's being gradually improved.
#
# Package thresholds are defined in this script and documented in coverage-analysis.md.
# The CI workflow enforces these thresholds by running this script.

# Define the overall threshold (aligned with realistic baseline)
OVERALL_THRESHOLD=${OVERALL_THRESHOLD:-35}

# Determine the module path
MODULE_PATH=$(grep -E '^module\s+' go.mod | awk '{print $2}')

# Define package-specific thresholds for quality gate enforcement
# Critical packages (95% requirement): Core business logic and interfaces
# Non-critical packages: Lower thresholds during improvement phase

# Define package paths

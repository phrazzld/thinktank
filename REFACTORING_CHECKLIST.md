# Refactoring Validation Checklist

This checklist ensures each function extraction follows Carmack's philosophy: **Simple, incremental, directly testable changes**.

## Pre-Extraction Planning

### Analysis Phase
- [ ] **Target Function Identified**: Function is >50 LOC or contains mixed concerns
- [ ] **Business Logic Separated**: Pure logic can be extracted from I/O operations
- [ ] **Dependencies Mapped**: All function dependencies and side effects documented
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Extraction plan maintains existing API surface
- [ ] **Test Strategy**: Plan for direct testing of extracted functions

### Success Criteria Defined
- [ ] **Clear Boundaries**: I/O operations vs pure business logic clearly identified
- [ ] **Function Scope**: Each extracted function has single, clear responsibility
- [ ] **Expected LOC**: Target ~10-100 LOC per extracted function
- [ ] **Testability**: Extracted functions should be directly testable without mocking

## During Extraction

### Code Organization
- [ ] **Pure Functions First**: Extract pure business logic before I/O operations
- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Each function does one thing well
- [ ] **Clear Naming**: Function names describe exactly what they do
- [ ] **Parameter Design**: Functions take minimal, well-typed parameters
- [ ] **Return Values**: Functions return results and errors, never call os.Exit()

### Implementation Quality
- [ ] **No Global State**: Functions avoid global variables and mutable state
- [ ] **No Side Effects**: Pure functions don't perform I/O or modify external state
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Proper error propagation without losing context
- [ ] **Documentation**: Clear godoc explaining function purpose and rationale
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Strong typing with appropriate interfaces and structs

### Carmack Principles Adherence
- [ ] **Incremental**: Extract one function at a time
- [ ] **Simple**: Each function is easy to understand and reason about
- [ ] **Testable**: Direct unit testing without complex setup or mocking
- [ ] **Isolated**: Functions can be tested independently
- [ ] **Composable**: Functions work together in predictable ways

## Post-Extraction Validation

### Functionality Verification
- [ ] **Original Behavior**: All existing functionality preserved exactly
- [ ] **API Compatibility**: No breaking changes to public interfaces
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Function compositions work correctly together
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Error conditions and boundary cases handled properly
- [ ] **Performance**: No significant performance regression (>5%)

### Code Quality Gates
- [ ] **Build Success**: `go build ./...` passes without errors
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: All tests passing with `go test ./...`
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: 90%+ coverage for extracted functions
- [ ] **Race Detection**: `go test -race ./...` passes without race conditions
- [ ] **Linting Clean**: `golangci-lint run ./...` reports zero violations

### Documentation and Testing
- [ ] **Godoc Comments**: Each function has clear documentation explaining purpose
- [ ] **Table-Driven Tests**: Comprehensive test cases for all code paths
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Function compositions tested for behavioral equivalence
- [ ] **Error Testing**: Error conditions and edge cases covered
- [ ] **Example Usage**: Clear examples of how to use extracted functions

## Quality Assurance Checklist

### Performance Validation
- [ ] **Benchmark Comparison**: Current vs baseline performance measured
- [ ] **Memory Profiling**: No significant memory allocation increases
- [ ] **Regression Testing**: Performance regression <5% for all metrics
- [ ] **Load Testing**: Functions perform well under expected load
- [ ] **Resource Usage**: No resource leaks or excessive allocations

### Security and Reliability
- [ ] **Input Validation**: All inputs properly validated
- [ ] **Error Sanitization**: No sensitive data leaked in error messages
- [ ] **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of resources (files, connections)
- [ ] **Thread Safety**: Functions are safe for concurrent use where intended
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Critical operations properly logged for audit trail

### Maintainability
- [ ] **Code Readability**: Functions are easy to read and understand
- [ ] **Logical Organization**: Related functions grouped appropriately
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Minimal coupling between functions
- [ ] **Future Extensions**: Design allows for easy future enhancements
- [ ] **Technical Debt**: No shortcuts or temporary fixes introduced

## Success Criteria Summary

A refactoring is complete when:

1. **Functionality**: Original behavior preserved exactly
2. **Quality**: All quality gates pass (build, test, lint, race detection)
3. **Performance**: No regression >5% in any benchmark metric
4. **Documentation**: All functions have clear documentation and examples
5. **Testing**: 90%+ coverage with comprehensive test cases
6. **Carmack Principles**: Simple, incremental, directly testable changes achieved

## Usage Guidelines

### Before Starting Refactoring
1. Review this checklist completely
2. Plan the extraction strategy
3. Define success criteria specific to your function
4. Set up baseline measurements (performance, coverage)

### During Refactoring
1. Check off items as you complete them
2. Stop and address any failing checklist items immediately
3. Run quality gates frequently (after each function extraction)
4. Maintain backward compatibility throughout the process

### After Completion
1. Verify all checklist items are completed
2. Run comprehensive validation (performance, integration, behavioral)
3. Document lessons learned for future refactoring
4. Update TODO.md with completion status and learnings

// Package thinktank contains the core application logic for the thinktank tool
package thinktank

// This file is now intentionally minimal as tests have been refactored into:
// - app_test_mocks.go: Mock implementations
// - app_test_helpers.go: Test helper functions
// - app_execute_test.go: Happy path and dry run tests
// - app_error_test.go: Error handling tests
// The refactoring was done to break up a large 1158-line test file.

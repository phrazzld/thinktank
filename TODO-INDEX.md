# Error Handling and Logging Consistency: Task Index

The "Enhance Error Handling and Logging Consistency" epic has been split into two focused implementation plans to improve manageability, testing thoroughness, and deployment safety. This index provides an overview of the split tasks and their interdependencies.

## Implementation Plans

1. **[TODO-1.md: Core Error & Logging Framework Refactor](./TODO-1.md)**
   - Focuses on establishing foundational error types and logging infrastructure
   - Includes refactoring of core internal components to use the new patterns
   - Must be completed, tested, and merged before starting Plan 2

2. **[TODO-2.md: Top-Level Handling, Output Usability & Finalization](./TODO-2.md)**
   - Builds upon the foundation from Plan 1
   - Implements top-level error handling, user-facing improvements, and finalization
   - Includes specific Thinktank Output Usability enhancements

## Implementation Sequence and Dependencies

- Plan 1 **must** be fully completed and merged before beginning Plan 2
- Plan 2 has critical dependencies on the types, interfaces, and patterns established in Plan 1

## Task Overview

### Plan 1: Core Error & Logging Framework Refactor
- Define `LLMError` type, `ErrorCategory` enum, and related helpers (T001-T006)
- Create `LoggerInterface` and implement `slog`-based structured logging (T007-T011)
- Refactor provider error handling for consistent translation to `LLMError` (T012-T013)
- Update core components to use context propagation, new logging, and error handling (T014-T019)

### Plan 2: Top-Level Handling, Output Usability & Finalization
- Setup application entry point with context and loggers (T020-T021)
- Implement security enhancements with log sanitization (T022)
- Add thinktank usability improvements (T025-T031)
- Conduct codebase cleanup and documentation updates (T023-T024)

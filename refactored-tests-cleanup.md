# Refactored Test Files Cleanup

## Overview
This document describes the findings and decisions made during the cleanup of duplicate test files in the integration package as part of task T032.

## Files Removed
The following files were removed from the codebase:

1. `/internal/integration/synthesis_flow_refactored_test.go`
2. `/internal/integration/no_synthesis_flow_refactored_test.go`
3. `/internal/integration/invalid_synthesis_model_refactored_test.go`

## Analysis

### Issue Description
The codebase contained duplicate test files with the `_refactored` suffix alongside the original test implementations. These duplicated files caused:
1. Redundant test execution - the same logical tests were being run twice
2. Potential maintenance burden - changes would need to be made in multiple places
3. Confusion about which implementation was considered the source of truth

### Files Comparison
After analyzing both versions of the test files, we observed:
1. The `_refactored` files used a newer testing approach with a boundary testing environment
2. The original files used a more direct testing approach with manual setup

### Decision
We decided to remove the `_refactored` test files for the following reasons:
1. The original test files were still functioning correctly
2. The test suite was already passing with the original files
3. There was no clear indication that the refactored files were meant to replace the originals
4. The original files contained more explicit test validation steps
5. No test coverage was lost by removing the refactored files

## Verification
After removing the refactored files:
1. All tests continue to pass (`go test ./...`)
2. No integration test coverage was lost
3. Build process completes successfully

## Future Considerations
If a complete test refactoring is planned in the future:
1. Consider migrating all tests to use the boundary testing environment pattern
2. Ensure proper communication and clear transition path when refactoring tests
3. Use proper branching strategy rather than keeping both versions in the same codebase

## Backup
A backup of the removed files was created in `/tmp/thinktank-backup/` for reference purposes if needed.

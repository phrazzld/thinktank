# CODEOWNERS
# This file defines individuals or teams responsible for code in this repository.
# Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request
# that modifies code they own.

# For more information: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# Protect CI/CD workflows from unreviewed changes
# Changes to any workflow files require review from designated maintainers
# This helps prevent accidental or malicious modifications to build/release processes
.github/workflows/ @phrazzld

# Additional owners can be added as needed:
# Example: /docs/ @documentation-team
# Example: /src/security/ @security-team

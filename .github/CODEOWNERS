# CODEOWNERS
# This file defines individuals or teams responsible for code in this repository.
# Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request
# that modifies code they own. GitHub will automatically request reviews from code owners
# when a pull request modifies any files that match the patterns defined in this file.

# ===== CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE =====

# CI/CD Workflow Protection - MANDATORY REVIEWS
# Changes to any workflow files require review from designated maintainers
# This is a critical security measure to prevent accidental or malicious
# modifications to build/release processes, which could lead to:
#  - Broken CI/CD pipelines
#  - Compromised builds
#  - Unauthorized code changes
#  - Supply chain attacks

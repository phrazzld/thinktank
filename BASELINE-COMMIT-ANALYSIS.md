# Baseline Commit Analysis for Conventional Commits Policy

## Commit Message Policy Timeline

Through analysis of the repository history, we've identified key commits related to the implementation of the Conventional Commits policy:

1. **Initial Commit Message Validation**:
   - Commit: `1300e4d675ac087783199f1e608409e6853e589f`
   - Message: "feat: use commitlint-github-action"
   - Date: Sun May 18 14:53:49 2025
   - This commit integrated `wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v5` for commit message validation in CI

2. **Pre-commit Hook Verification**:
   - Commit: `49ae824c0dc9867c66b42940202adb514a878695`
   - Message: "feat: add pre-commit hook verification script"
   - Date: Sun May 18 15:29:56 2025
   - Added `scripts/verify-hooks.sh` to verify pre-commit and commit-msg hooks

3. **Comprehensive Hook Installation**:
   - Commit: `22f9952e57427f041cef50a5dfcb360d01b79e05`
   - Message: "chore: ensure git hooks are mandatory and auto-installed"
   - Date: Mon May 19 11:15:39 2025
   - Enhanced hook installation process and made pre-commit hooks mandatory

## Recommended Baseline Commit

Based on this analysis, we recommend establishing commit `1300e4d675ac087783199f1e608409e6853e589f` as the baseline for commit message validation. This is when Conventional Commits validation was officially integrated into the CI pipeline with commitlint.

### Baseline Details:
- **Commit SHA**: `1300e4d675ac087783199f1e608409e6853e589f`
- **Date**: Sun May 18 14:53:49 2025
- **Significance**: First integration of commitlint for Conventional Commits validation

## Implementation Approach

For T049 and related tasks, we should use this baseline commit as the reference point. Specifically:

1. Configure commitlint to only validate commits made after this baseline using:
   ```
   --from=1300e4d675ac087783199f1e608409e6853e589f
   ```

2. Document this baseline in all relevant configuration files and documentation.

3. Ensure all CI workflow updates and local validation tools use this consistent baseline reference.

This approach will ensure that:
- Historical commits before the Conventional Commits policy was established are exempted from validation
- All new commits after the policy establishment are properly validated
- CI passes for branches containing both old and new commits

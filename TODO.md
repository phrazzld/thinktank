# CI Resolution Tasks for PR #110

## High Priority Tasks

- [x] ### [CI FIX] Find and examine the failing integration test files
- Navigate to `internal/integration` package
- Locate synthesis-related test files
- Identify which specific tests are failing

- [x] ### [CI FIX] Identify how test models are mocked in synthesis tests
- Review test setup and mock configurations
- Understand how test models are created
- Check mock response patterns

- [x] ### [CI FIX] Review test model mock implementations for 'invalid request' errors
**DISCOVERED ROOT CAUSE**:
- "invalid request" errors come from `model_processing.go:454` when LLM errors are categorized as `llm.CategoryInvalidRequest`
- CI failure occurs when integration tests use real model names (`gpt-4.1`, `test-model-2`) that trigger actual model validation
- In CI environment, real model validation fails → gets categorized as invalid request → returns "invalid request"
- Tests pass locally because mocks work properly, fail in CI where real validation occurs
- **Solution**: Tests need better mock isolation to avoid hitting real model validation logic

- [x] ### [CI FIX] Update mock model responses to handle new configurations
**COMPLETED**: Updated boundary test adapter in `boundary_test_adapter.go:426-427`
- Added Kimi K2 specific handling: 131,072 context window & max output tokens
- Ensures boundary tests use correct token limits for new model
- All integration tests continue to pass with updated mock configuration

- [x] ### Run integration tests locally to reproduce failure
- Execute `go test ./internal/integration -v`
- Capture detailed error output
- Confirm failure matches CI logs

- [x] ### Apply fixes and verify all tests pass
- Implement identified fixes
- Run full test suite: `go test ./...`
- Ensure no regressions

## Medium Priority Tasks

- [x] ### [CI FIX] Check and update model count expectations in tests
- Search for hardcoded model counts in tests
- Update expectations to include Kimi K2
- Verify dynamic model counting where possible

- [x] ### [CI FIX] Verify synthesis test assertions for partial success scenarios
**COMPLETED**: Comprehensive analysis confirms excellent test coverage
- ✅ Synthesis tests properly handle partial failures with `ErrPartialProcessingFailure`
- ✅ 67% success rate (2/3 models) is extensively tested in multiple test files
- ✅ Resilience verified: synthesis continues with successful models despite failures
- ✅ All edge cases covered: 0%, 60%, 67%, 75%, 100% success rates
- ✅ Proper error messages, logging, and file outputs for partial failure scenarios
- **Tests passing**: `TestBoundarySynthesisWithPartialFailure` and related tests working correctly

## Low Priority Tasks

- [x] ### [CODE FIX] Validate Kimi K2 model definition correctness
**VERIFIED CORRECT**: All parameters properly configured
- ✅ Provider: "openrouter" (unified provider architecture)
- ✅ API Model ID: "moonshotai/kimi-k2" (correct OpenRouter format)
- ✅ Context Window: 131072 (128K tokens, appropriate for Kimi models)
- ✅ Max Output Tokens: 131072 (matches context window)
- ✅ Default parameters: temperature 0.7, top_p 0.95 (reasonable defaults)
- ✅ Parameter constraints: all properly defined with valid ranges
- ✅ Model accessible via GetModelInfo() and included in ListAllModels()
- ✅ Integration with boundary test adapter: matching 131072 values on line 427

- [x] ### Clean up temporary CI analysis files
**COMPLETED**: No temporary files found to clean up
- ❌ `CI-FAILURE-SUMMARY.md` - File does not exist (already cleaned or never created)
- ❌ `CI-RESOLUTION-PLAN.md` - File does not exist (already cleaned or never created)
- ✅ Verified all existing analysis files are legitimate (benchmarks, performance reports, test files)
- ✅ CI logs directory is empty
- ✅ No temporary CI analysis files requiring cleanup

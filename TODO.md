# TODO: Eliminate Subprocess Test Architecture - Refactor for Testability

## Critical Path: Fix the Architecture, Not the Symptoms

**Objective**: Transform fragile subprocess tests into deterministic, fast unit tests by extracting business logic from main() into testable functions with dependency injection.

**Success Criteria**: All tests pass reliably in CI, no subprocess test flakiness, better test coverage, maintainable architecture.

---

## Phase 1: Architecture Analysis & Interface Design

### Understanding Current State
- [x] **Audit current main() function** in `internal/cli/main.go` (lines 211-338)
  - Document all external dependencies (filesystem, logger, API services)
  - Identify side effects and global state mutations
  - Map control flow and error handling patterns

- [x] **Analyze failing subprocess tests** in `internal/cli/main_test.go` âœ… COMPLETED
  - âœ… `TestMainDryRun` and `TestMainConfigurationOptions` - ALREADY CONVERTED to direct function tests in `run_direct_test.go`
  - âœ… These tests now exist as: `TestRunDryRunSuccess`, `TestRunWithAuditLogging`, `TestRunWithVerboseLogging`, `TestRunWithQuietMode`, `TestRunWithCustomTimeout`, `TestRunWithRateLimiting`, `TestRunWithCustomPermissions`, `TestRunWithMultipleModels`, `TestRunWithFileFiltering`
  - ðŸ”„ **Remaining subprocess tests to analyze:**
    - `TestHandleError` (lines 48-233) - Tests error categorization and exit code mapping for 12 different error types
    - `TestHandleErrorAuditLogFailure` (lines 236-262) - Tests error handling when audit logging fails
    - `TestMainFunction` (lines 328-369) - Tests Main() function flag validation and early exit behavior
  - **Coverage Analysis:**
    - **Lost coverage**: Actual os.Exit() behavior verification, real stderr output, end-to-end Main() integration
    - **Gained coverage**: Faster execution, better diagnostics, easier debugging, more reliable CI
    - **Conversion strategy**: Extract error categorization logic from handleError() into testable functions that don't call os.Exit()

- [x] **Review dependency injection patterns** in existing codebase âœ… COMPLETED
  - âœ… Analyzed `thinktank.Execute()` dependency injection pattern - serves as gold standard
  - âœ… Examined `logutil.LoggerInterface` and `auditlog.AuditLogger` patterns - comprehensive context-aware design
  - âœ… Discovered RunConfig/RunResult structures already implemented in `internal/cli/run_interfaces.go`
  - âœ… Found comprehensive mock infrastructure in `internal/cli/run_mocks.go`
  - âœ… Identified adapter patterns in `internal/thinktank/adapters.go`
  - âœ… **Key Finding**: Dependency injection architecture is already extensively implemented and follows excellent design patterns
  - âœ… **Documentation**: Created comprehensive analysis in `DEPENDENCY_INJECTION_ANALYSIS.md`

### Interface Design
- [x] **Define RunConfig struct** to replace os.Args/os.Environ dependencies âœ… COMPLETED
  - âœ… **Already implemented** in `internal/cli/run_interfaces.go` lines 18-35
  - âœ… Includes Context, Config, Logger, AuditLogger, APIService, ConsoleWriter, FileSystem, ExitHandler, ContextGatherer
  - âœ… More comprehensive than originally planned - includes all necessary dependencies

- [x] **Design RunResult struct** for testable return values âœ… COMPLETED
  - âœ… **Already implemented** in `internal/cli/run_interfaces.go` lines 38-46
  - âœ… Includes ExitCode, Error, and ExecutionStats for detailed testing
  - âœ… ExecutionStats tracks FilesProcessed, APICalls, Duration, AuditEntriesWritten

- [x] **Define injectable filesystem interface** for file operations âœ… COMPLETED
  - âœ… **Already implemented** in `internal/cli/run_interfaces.go` lines 48-55
  - âœ… Comprehensive interface with CreateTemp, WriteFile, ReadFile, Remove, MkdirAll, OpenFile
  - âœ… Production implementation in `internal/cli/run_implementations.go` (OSFileSystem)
  - âœ… Mock implementation in `internal/cli/run_mocks.go` (MockFileSystem)

## Phase 2: Extract Business Logic from main() âœ… COMPLETED

### Create Run() Function
- [x] **Extract core business logic** from `main()` into `Run(*RunConfig) *RunResult` âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] **Update main() to be thin wrapper** âœ… COMPLETED
  - âœ… **Already implemented** in `internal/cli/main.go` lines 217-278
  - âœ… Main() is a thin wrapper: parses flags, sets up dependencies, calls Run()
  - âœ… Uses `NewProductionRunConfig()` factory function for dependency setup
  - âœ… Handles Run() result and exits with appropriate code

### Implement Real FileSystem
- [x] **Create production FileSystem implementation** âœ… COMPLETED
  - âœ… **Already implemented** as `OSFileSystem` in `internal/cli/run_implementations.go`

- [ ] **Test execution time** reduces by >50% (no subprocess overhead)
- [ ] **Zero test flakiness** - tests pass consistently across all environments

### Quality
- [ ] **Test coverage** maintained at >=90% or improved
- [ ] **Test clarity** - each test has single responsibility and clear assertions
- [ ] **Maintainability** - adding new main() logic doesn't require complex test setup

### Architecture
- [ ] **main() function** reduced to <20 lines (thin wrapper)
- [ ] **Business logic** fully testable without subprocess execution
- [ ] **Dependency injection** enables easy mocking and testing

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Plan
- [ ] **Keep subprocess tests** during refactor until new tests prove equivalent coverage
- [ ] **Feature flag approach** - run both test suites in parallel initially
- [ ] **Quick revert** capability if CI stability degrades

### Validation Steps
- [ ] **Manual testing** of all scenarios covered by subprocess tests
- [ ] **Stress testing** - run new test suite 100+ times to verify stability
- [ ] **Cross-platform testing** - ensure behavior consistent across Linux/macOS/Windows

## Expected Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Analysis)**: 2-3 hours
- **Phase 2 (Refactor)**: 4-5 hours
- **Phase 3 (Test Conversion)**: 6-8 hours
- **Phase 4 (Integration)**: 2-3 hours
- **Phase 5 (Cleanup)**: 2-3 hours
- **Phase 6 (Documentation)**: 1-2 hours
- **Total Estimated Time**: ~20 hours over 3-4 days

## Notes

This follows John Carmack's principles:
- **Atomic tasks** - each checkbox is independently actionable
- **Root cause focus** - fixing architecture rather than symptoms
- **Measurable outcomes** - clear success criteria for each step
- **Risk mitigation** - rollback plans and validation steps
- **Simplicity** - removing complexity rather than managing it

The fundamental insight: subprocess tests are architectural debt. By eliminating them and extracting testable business logic, we achieve better reliability, coverage, and maintainability simultaneously.

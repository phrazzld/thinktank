# TODO: Eliminate Subprocess Test Architecture - Refactor for Testability

## Critical Path: Fix the Architecture, Not the Symptoms

**Objective**: Transform fragile subprocess tests into deterministic, fast unit tests by extracting business logic from main() into testable functions with dependency injection.

**Success Criteria**: All tests pass reliably in CI, no subprocess test flakiness, better test coverage, maintainable architecture.

---

## Phase 1: Architecture Analysis & Interface Design

### Understanding Current State
- [x] **Audit current main() function** in `internal/cli/main.go` (lines 211-338)
  - Document all external dependencies (filesystem, logger, API services)
  - Identify side effects and global state mutations
  - Map control flow and error handling patterns

- [x] **Analyze failing subprocess tests** in `internal/cli/main_test.go` ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ `TestMainDryRun` and `TestMainConfigurationOptions` - ALREADY CONVERTED to direct function tests in `run_direct_test.go`
  - ✅ These tests now exist as: `TestRunDryRunSuccess`, `TestRunWithAuditLogging`, `TestRunWithVerboseLogging`, `TestRunWithQuietMode`, `TestRunWithCustomTimeout`, `TestRunWithRateLimiting`, `TestRunWithCustomPermissions`, `TestRunWithMultipleModels`, `TestRunWithFileFiltering`
  - 🔄 **Remaining subprocess tests to analyze:**
    - `TestHandleError` (lines 48-233) - Tests error categorization and exit code mapping for 12 different error types
    - `TestHandleErrorAuditLogFailure` (lines 236-262) - Tests error handling when audit logging fails
    - `TestMainFunction` (lines 328-369) - Tests Main() function flag validation and early exit behavior
  - **Coverage Analysis:**
    - **Lost coverage**: Actual os.Exit() behavior verification, real stderr output, end-to-end Main() integration
    - **Gained coverage**: Faster execution, better diagnostics, easier debugging, more reliable CI
    - **Conversion strategy**: Extract error categorization logic from handleError() into testable functions that don't call os.Exit()

- [x] **Review dependency injection patterns** in existing codebase ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Analyzed `thinktank.Execute()` dependency injection pattern - serves as gold standard
  - ✅ Examined `logutil.LoggerInterface` and `auditlog.AuditLogger` patterns - comprehensive context-aware design
  - ✅ Discovered RunConfig/RunResult structures already implemented in `internal/cli/run_interfaces.go`
  - ✅ Found comprehensive mock infrastructure in `internal/cli/run_mocks.go`
  - ✅ Identified adapter patterns in `internal/thinktank/adapters.go`
  - ✅ **Key Finding**: Dependency injection architecture is already extensively implemented and follows excellent design patterns
  - ✅ **Documentation**: Created comprehensive analysis in `DEPENDENCY_INJECTION_ANALYSIS.md`

### Interface Design
- [x] **Define RunConfig struct** to replace os.Args/os.Environ dependencies ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ **Already implemented** in `internal/cli/run_interfaces.go` lines 18-35
  - ✅ Includes Context, Config, Logger, AuditLogger, APIService, ConsoleWriter, FileSystem, ExitHandler, ContextGatherer

- [x] **Design RunResult struct** for testable return values ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ **Already implemented** in `internal/cli/run_interfaces.go` lines 38-46
  - ✅ Includes ExitCode, Error, and ExecutionStats for detailed testing
  - ✅ ExecutionStats tracks FilesProcessed, APICalls, Duration, AuditEntriesWritten

- [x] **Define injectable filesystem interface** for file operations ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ **Already implemented** in `internal/cli/run_interfaces.go` lines 48-55
  - ✅ Comprehensive interface with CreateTemp, WriteFile, ReadFile, Remove, MkdirAll, OpenFile

  - ✅ Uses injected FileSystem, Logger, AuditLogger, APIService, etc.
  - ✅ All external dependencies are abstracted through interfaces

- [x] **Update main() to be thin wrapper** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ **Already implemented** in `internal/cli/main.go` lines 217-278

  - ✅ Uses `NewProductionRunConfig()` factory function for dependency setup
  - ✅ Handles Run() result and exits with appropriate code

### Implement Real FileSystem
- [x] **Create production FileSystem implementation** ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ **Already implemented** as `OSFileSystem` in `internal/cli/run_implementations.go`

  - Run `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...` to test coverage generation
  - Verify no test directories remain after test execution

- [ ] **CI Validation**
  - Push changes and verify CI pipeline passes
  - Confirm coverage generation step completes successfully
  - Validate all test jobs complete without permission errors
  - Check that no test artifacts are left in CI environment

## Notes

This follows John Carmack's principles:
- **Atomic tasks** - each checkbox is independently actionable
- **Root cause focus** - fixing architecture rather than symptoms
- **Measurable outcomes** - clear success criteria for each step
- **Risk mitigation** - rollback plans and validation steps
- **Simplicity** - removing complexity rather than managing it

The fundamental insight: subprocess tests are architectural debt. By eliminating them and extracting testable business logic, we achieve better reliability, coverage, and maintainability simultaneously.

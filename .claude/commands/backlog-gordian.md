# BACKLOG-GORDIAN

## GOAL
Identify opportunities for radical simplification and creative destruction in the current project codebase, adding transformative tasks to local BACKLOG.md.

## 1. Project Context Analysis
- Read local BACKLOG.md to understand existing tasks and avoid duplication
- Analyze current project structure, identifying areas of complexity and coupling
- Review existing code patterns and architectural decisions

## 2. Create Context File
- Create `GORDIAN-CONTEXT.md` with the following content:
  ```markdown
  # Radical Simplification Context

  ## Current BACKLOG.md Status
  [Include summary of existing backlog items to avoid duplication]

  ## Project Complexity Analysis
  [Overview of current project's complex areas, tight coupling, or overengineered components]

  ## Request
  Identify components in the current project codebase that could benefit from radical simplification or creative destruction.
  Focus on "cutting the Gordian knot" - eliminating complexity rather than managing it.
  Add concrete transformation tasks to BACKLOG.md for THIS specific project.
  ```

## 3. Generate Gordian Opportunities
- **Leyline Pre-Processing**: Focus on simplification-oriented principles:
  - Query leyline tenets emphasizing simplicity, orthogonality, and eliminating complexity
  - Identify leyline bindings that enforce minimalism and clean architecture
  - Internalize radical simplification patterns from the leyline knowledge base
- **Think very hard** about radical simplification opportunities in THIS PROJECT by:
  - **Existence justification**: Challenge why each component/abstraction exists in current codebase - could it be eliminated entirely?
  - **Radical simplification**: Identify opportunities to replace complex systems with dramatically simpler solutions in current project
  - **Architectural transformation**: Consider paradigm shifts that could eliminate entire categories of complexity from current codebase
  - **Automation opportunities**: Find ways to automate quality/testing that remove manual overhead for this project
  - **Assumption challenging**: Question fundamental assumptions about current project's requirements, constraints, and architecture
  - **Coupling analysis**: Identify tightly coupled components that could be drastically simplified or eliminated
  - **Overengineering detection**: Find abstractions that add complexity without proportional value in current project context

## 4. Apply Transformative Thinking
- Seek solutions that make current project problems disappear rather than solving them incrementally
- Focus on eliminating unnecessary complexity at its root in current codebase, not just managing it
- Consider "what if we didn't need this at all?" for each complex component
- Look for opportunities to replace multiple complex components with single simple solutions
- Balance boldness with practicality - solutions should be revolutionary but achievable for current project

## 5. Add Tasks to BACKLOG.md
- **Format**: Add tasks using standard BACKLOG.md format:
  ```
  - [ ] [PRIORITY] [GORDIAN] Specific radical simplification description
  ```
- **Organization**: Add to appropriate priority section in BACKLOG.md
- **Specificity**: Each task should be:
  - Focused on dramatic simplification of current project components
  - Reference specific files/modules/systems in current codebase
  - Include clear transformation strategy and expected benefits
  - Estimate complexity reduction potential
  - Consider implementation risk and validation strategy

## 6. Document Analysis
- Update `GORDIAN-CONTEXT.md` with analysis results
- Include rationale for each major simplification opportunity
- Document assumptions being challenged and alternatives considered
- Note any current project constraints that influence simplification approaches

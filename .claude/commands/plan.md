# Strategic Implementation Planner - Multi-Expert Analysis for Thinktank

Create comprehensive implementation plans using legendary programmer perspectives and thorough research.

**Usage**: `/project:plan`

## GOAL

Generate the best possible implementation plan for the task described in TASK.md by:
- Conducting exhaustive research and context gathering for the thinktank CLI tool
- Leveraging multiple expert programming personas through subagents
- Synthesizing diverse perspectives into a strongly opinionated recommendation optimized for Go CLI development

## ANALYZE

Your job is to make the best possible implementation plan for the task described in TASK.md.

### Phase 1: Foundation Research
1. Read TASK.md thoroughly to understand requirements and constraints
2. Comb through the thinktank codebase to collect relevant context and patterns:
   - Analyze Go module structure and provider architecture
   - Review existing model definitions and integration patterns
   - Understand CLI argument handling and error management
   - Study current testing approaches and coverage requirements
3. Read relevant leyline documents in `./docs/leyline/` for foundational principles:
   - Focus on Go-specific bindings and simplicity tenets
   - Review integration-first testing and interface design patterns
4. Use context7 MCP server to research relevant documentation (if available)
5. Conduct web searches on the problem domain, Go best practices, and LLM API integration patterns

### Phase 2: Multi-Expert Analysis
Launch parallel subagents embodying legendary programmer perspectives using the Task tool:

**Task 1: John Carmack Perspective**
- Prompt: "As John Carmack, analyze this task focusing on performance optimization, elegant algorithms, and first principles thinking. What would be the most algorithmically sound and performance-optimized approach for implementing this in the thinktank Go CLI? Consider concurrent API processing, rate limiting efficiency, memory management, and computational complexity."

**Task 2: Rob Pike Perspective**
- Prompt: "As Rob Pike, one of Go's creators, analyze this task from Go philosophy, simplicity, and concurrency perspectives. How would you ensure this follows Go idioms, leverages goroutines effectively, and maintains the clarity that Go is known for? Focus on making the concurrent and the simple."

**Task 3: Linus Torvalds Perspective**
- Prompt: "As Linus Torvalds, analyze this task focusing on pragmatic engineering, reliability, and robust system design. What would be the most practical, no-nonsense approach that handles edge cases gracefully? Consider error handling, rate limiting, and real-world API reliability issues."

**Task 4: Russ Cox Perspective**
- Prompt: "As Russ Cox, analyze this task from Go toolchain and language design perspectives. How would you design this to align with Go's type system, error handling patterns, and testing philosophy? Focus on maintainability and proper abstraction boundaries."

**Task 5: Mitchell Hashimoto Perspective**
- Prompt: "As Mitchell Hashimoto, analyze this task focusing on building excellent developer tools and CLI experiences. What approach would create the best user experience for thinktank users while being practically implementable? Consider configuration, API key management, and graceful degradation."

### Phase 3: Design Exploration
For each approach, consider:
- **Simplest solutions**: Most straightforward, minimal viable approaches following Go's simplicity philosophy
- **Complex solutions**: Comprehensive implementations with advanced features like circuit breakers, retry strategies
- **Creative solutions**: Innovative approaches leveraging Go's unique features (channels, interfaces, goroutines)
- **Hybrid approaches**: Combinations that balance the leyline principles with practical requirements

## EXECUTE

1. **Foundation Analysis**
   - Read and thoroughly understand TASK.md requirements
   - Map out current thinktank architecture:
     * Provider abstraction patterns
     * Model definition structure
     * Rate limiting implementation
     * Error handling hierarchy
   - Research LLM API best practices and rate limiting strategies

2. **Launch Expert Subagents**
   - Use the Task tool to create independent subagents for each programming legend
   - Have each analyze the problem through their distinctive lens
   - Collect their unique recommendations and implementation approaches

3. **Cross-Pollination Round**
   - Launch follow-up subagents that review all expert perspectives
   - Identify synergies between different approaches
   - Generate hybrid solutions that combine the best insights
   - Focus on Go-specific optimizations and patterns

4. **Synthesis and Evaluation**
   - Compare all approaches across multiple dimensions:
     * Go idiom compliance and code clarity
     * Performance characteristics (goroutine usage, memory efficiency)
     * Testing strategy alignment with leyline's integration-first approach
     * Error handling robustness and user experience
     * Implementation complexity vs maintainability
   - Evaluate tradeoffs specific to the thinktank project:
     * Multiple provider support complexity
     * Rate limiting across different API tiers
     * Configuration management approaches
     * Test coverage requirements (90% target)

5. **Strategic Recommendation**
   - Present the best implementation approach with clear Go-specific rationale
   - Include specific design patterns from the codebase to follow
   - Provide implementation phases that maintain test coverage
   - Document alternative approaches and their tradeoffs
   - Include success metrics aligned with thinktank's goals

## Success Criteria

- Comprehensive analysis incorporating multiple expert perspectives on Go development
- Clear, actionable implementation plan following thinktank's established patterns
- Adherence to leyline principles, especially simplicity and testability
- Strategic approach that maximizes reliability for multi-model LLM processing
- Integration with existing provider architecture and rate limiting systems

# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for thinktank.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures a significant architectural decision along with its context and consequences. We record decisions that:
- Future readers will ask "why?"
- Constrain future options
- Would be expensive to change

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| [001](001-openrouter-unified-provider.md) | OpenRouter as Unified Provider | Accepted |
| [002](002-orchestrator-pattern.md) | Orchestrator Pattern for Concurrent Execution | Accepted |

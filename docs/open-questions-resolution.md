# Open Questions Resolution Status

## 1. Clarify initial semantic version for migration (BLOCKING) ✅
**Status: RESOLVED**
- Initial version `v1.0.0` was created in T018
- Tag exists in the repository
- No further action needed

## 2. Define prerelease workflow for alpha/beta/rc builds ⏳
**Status: SUPPORTED BUT NOT DOCUMENTED**
- The CI workflow already supports prerelease tags (e.g., `v0.1.0-alpha`)
- The pattern `v*` in release.yml matches all version tags including prereleases
- Could benefit from documentation but not blocking

## 3. Document hotfix process for older released versions ⏳
**Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- Would involve:
  - Creating a branch from the old tag
  - Cherry-picking fixes
  - Creating a patch release (e.g., v1.0.1)
- Not blocking current work

## 4. Finalize who/what commits CHANGELOG.md updates (BLOCKING) ✅
**Status: RESOLVED**
- CHANGELOG.md header states: "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE MANUALLY"
- Automated process via git-chglog during releases
- CI pipeline handles all changelog updates
- No manual commits needed

## 5. Review sufficiency of make tools / tools.go approach ✅
**Status: SUFFICIENT**
- Makefile has comprehensive targets including `make tools`
- tools.go pins all required development tools
- Installation process documented in README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md
- Working well for current needs

## Recommendations

1. Mark issues #1, #4, and #5 as resolved in TODO.md
2. Keep #2 and #3 as future enhancements (non-blocking)
3. Consider creating separate documentation for prerelease and hotfix workflows when needed

# CI Commit Message Validation Test Results

## Test Objective
Verify that the CI pipeline correctly fails when commits with invalid Conventional Commit messages are pushed.

## Test Execution Date
January 14, 2025

## Test Methodology

1. Created a test file `test-ci-validation.md` 
2. Attempted to commit with invalid message: "This is an invalid commit message without type prefix"
3. Pre-commit hook correctly blocked the commit locally
4. Bypassed pre-commit hook using `--no-verify` flag
5. Pushed the invalid commit to trigger CI validation

## Results

### Local Pre-commit Hook
✅ Successfully blocked invalid commit with error:
```
commitlint

→ input: "This is an invalid com..."

Errors:
  ❌ parser: type: invalid character ' '

Total 1 errors, 0 warnings, 0 other severities
```

### CI Pipeline Behavior
The CI pipeline should fail on the commit validation step. To verify the results:

1. Check GitHub Actions tab for the failed workflow run
2. Review the logs for commit validation errors
3. Confirm that the failure occurs before any build/test steps

## Test Cases Covered

1. ✅ Non-conventional commit format without type prefix
2. ⏳ Invalid type prefix (future test)
3. ⏳ Missing scope when required (future test)

## Conclusions

The local pre-commit hook successfully prevents invalid commits under normal circumstances. When bypassed with `--no-verify`, invalid commits can reach the CI pipeline, where they should be caught by the CI validation step as configured in T014.

## Recommendations

1. Ensure CI logs clearly indicate commit validation failures
2. Consider documenting the bypass scenario in developer documentation
3. Add automated tests for other invalid commit formats

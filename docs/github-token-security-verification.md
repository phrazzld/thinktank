# GitHub Token Security Verification (T024)

## Verification Date
January 14, 2025

## Objective
Verify that GITHUB_TOKEN is configured with correct permissions in CI and does not expose secrets in logs.

## Security Configuration Review

### 1. Permissions Configuration
The workflow correctly defines permissions at the workflow level:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write  # Required for goreleaser to create releases
  id-token: write  # Optional: for OIDC if needed later
```

✅ **Contents: write** is configured (required for creating releases and tags)
✅ **Packages: write** is not needed for this project (no package publishing)
✅ **id-token: write** is included for future OIDC support

### 2. Token Usage
The GITHUB_TOKEN is correctly used only in the goreleaser step:

```yaml
- name: Run Goreleaser (Snapshot for PR/master, Release for tags)
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

✅ Token is passed as an environment variable
✅ Token is accessed via `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` (GitHub's secure mechanism)
✅ No direct token values in the workflow

### 3. Secret Protection
Review of the workflow shows:

✅ No `echo` or `print` statements that output the token
✅ Token is only used by goreleaser, which handles it securely
✅ No custom scripts that might accidentally log the token
✅ GitHub automatically masks secrets in logs

### 4. Principle of Least Privilege
The permissions follow least privilege principle:

✅ Only `contents: write` for release operations
✅ No unnecessary permissions granted
✅ `id-token: write` is optional and clearly documented

## Testing & Verification

1. **Log Review**: CI logs do not expose the GITHUB_TOKEN value
2. **Release Functionality**: Token permissions allow:
   - Creating GitHub releases (for version tags)
   - Uploading release artifacts
   - Creating/updating release notes

3. **Security Features**:
   - GitHub automatically masks the token in logs
   - Token is scoped to the current repository only
   - Token expires after the workflow completes

## Conclusion

The GITHUB_TOKEN configuration in `.github/workflows/release.yml` is correctly implemented with:
- ✅ Appropriate permissions (`contents: write`)
- ✅ Secure usage pattern (environment variable)
- ✅ No secret exposure risks
- ✅ Follows security best practices

No changes are required to the current configuration.

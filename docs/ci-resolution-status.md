# CI Resolution Status - T031

## Current CI Status

As of the latest push, the CI pipeline is still failing due to an issue with the go-conventionalcommits installation.

### Failed Checks

1. **Lint, Test & Build Check** - FAILED
   - Failure at step: "Install go-conventionalcommits"
   - Error: `package github.com/leodido/go-conventionalcommits is not a main package`
   - Root cause: go-conventionalcommits is a library, not a CLI tool

2. **docs / sync** - FAILED (multiple instances)
   - Appears to be cascading failures

3. **Lint and Format** - PASSED
   - This check passes successfully

### Key Finding

The CI workflow in `.github/workflows/release.yml` attempts to:
1. Install go-conventionalcommits as a CLI tool
2. Use `go-conventionalcommits validate` command

However, go-conventionalcommits is a Go library, not a command-line tool. It cannot be installed with `go install` and doesn't provide a CLI interface.

### Required Fix

The CI workflow needs to be updated to either:
1. Use a different tool for commit message validation (like commitlint)
2. Build a custom wrapper around the go-conventionalcommits library
3. Remove this validation step if it's redundant with pre-commit hooks

### Tasks Status

All CI resolution tasks (T025-T030) have been completed and pushed:
- T025: Updated go-conventionalcommits installation (but the fix was incorrect)
- T026: Updated tools.go
- T027: Updated Makefile
- T028: Updated CONTRIBUTING.md
- T029: Verified pre-commit configuration
- T030: Applied formatting fixes

However, the fundamental issue remains that the CI workflow is trying to use a library as a CLI tool.

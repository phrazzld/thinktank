# Coverage Baseline Measurement

**Date**: Sun Jun 22 15:34:29 PDT 2025
**Go Version**: go version go1.24.2 darwin/arm64
**Baseline Coverage**: 77.4%
**Target Coverage**: 80.0%
**Gap**: 2.6 percentage points

## Measurement Methodology

1. **Command**: `go test -coverprofile=baseline.out ./...`
2. **Coverage Calculation**: `go tool cover -func=baseline.out | tail -1`
3. **Verification**: 3 consecutive runs show identical 77.4% result
4. **Script Consistency**: `./scripts/check-coverage.sh` produces identical measurement

## Key Findings

- Measurement is 100% reproducible and consistent
- No build tag or compilation issues affecting coverage
- Both direct go test and existing script agree on baseline
- 2 packages filtered by script (integration, testutil) but still counted in total coverage

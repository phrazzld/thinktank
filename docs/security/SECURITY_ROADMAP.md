# Security Scanning Roadmap: Phase 2 Enhancements

## Current State (Phase 1 Complete)
- ✅ **govulncheck Integration**: Module-level vulnerability scanning for Go dependencies
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated scanning on all commits and PRs with failure enforcement
- ✅ **Reporting**: Dual-format reports (JSON + text) with 30-day artifact retention
- ✅ **Performance**: <3 minute execution time with parallel job execution
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Retry logic, timeout protection, and clear failure messaging

## Phase 2: Enhanced Security Coverage (Q2-Q3 2025)

### GitHub Dependency Scanning Integration
**Rationale**: Complement govulncheck with GitHub's native dependency scanning for broader coverage

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **Enable GitHub Dependency Graph**: Already enabled for public repos
2. **Configure Dependabot Alerts**: Native GitHub vulnerability detection
3. **Add Dependency Review Action**: Block PRs with vulnerable dependencies
4. **Integration Strategy**:
   - govulncheck: Go-specific, code-impact analysis (keep as primary)
   - GitHub scanning: Broader ecosystem, supply chain security (add as secondary)
   - Fail if EITHER scanner detects vulnerabilities

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
**Risk**: Potential for alert fatigue, need careful threshold tuning

### Container Scanning Preparation
**Trigger**: If project adds Docker containers, Kubernetes deployments, or container images

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **Tool Selection**: Trivy (comprehensive, fast, Go-native)
2. **Scan Targets**: Base images, dependencies, configuration files
3. **Integration Points**:
   - CI pipeline: Scan built images before registry push
   - Registry integration: Continuous monitoring of stored images
   - Local development: Pre-commit scanning capability

**Implementation Steps**:
```yaml
# Future CI job when containers are added
container-scan:
  name: Container Security Scan
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [build]
  steps:
    - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
      uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
      with:
        image-ref: 'thinktank:latest'
        format: 'sarif'
        output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
    - name: Upload Trivy scan results
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
      with:
        sarif_file: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks after container adoption
**Dependencies**: Container adoption, registry setup

## Phase 3: Advanced Security Features (Q4 2025)

### Supply Chain Security
- **SLSA Framework**: Build provenance and integrity verification
- **Sigstore Integration**: Code signing and verification pipeline
- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials for dependency tracking

### Security Policy Automation
- **Policy as Code**: Define security policies in repository
- **Automated Remediation**: Auto-create PRs for vulnerability fixes
- **Risk Scoring**: Prioritize vulnerabilities based on code usage analysis

## Success Metrics & Decision Framework

### Implementation Triggers
1. **GitHub Dependency Scanning**:
   - Trigger: >5 false negatives from govulncheck in 6 months
   - Metric: Zero undetected vulnerabilities in production

2. **Container Scanning**:
   - Trigger: Addition of any container/Docker usage to project
   - Metric: 100% container image vulnerability coverage

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Trigger: Team grows >10 contributors OR handles sensitive data
   - Metric: <1% security incident rate, <24hr vulnerability response time

### Rollback Criteria
- **Performance Impact**: >5 minute CI execution times consistently
- **False Positive Rate**: >20% false alarms requiring manual investigation
- **Developer Experience**: >3 CI failures per week due to scanning infrastructure

### Monitoring Dashboard
Track key metrics for decision-making:
- Vulnerability detection rate (true positives vs false positives)
- Mean time to vulnerability resolution
- CI performance impact (execution time trends)
- Developer productivity metrics (blocked PRs, override requests)

## Resource Requirements

### Phase 2 Implementation
- **Engineering Time**: 2-3 weeks for GitHub integration, 4-6 weeks total
- **Infrastructure**: No additional costs (GitHub native features)
- **Maintenance**: 2-4 hours/month ongoing tuning and monitoring

### Phase 3 Planning
- **Engineering Time**: 6-8 weeks for advanced features
- **Infrastructure**: Potential external service costs for SLSA/Sigstore
- **Training**: Security team upskilling on advanced tools

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- GitHub dependency scanning (native, well-tested)
- Container scanning with Trivy (established tool, good Go ecosystem support)

### Medium Risk
- Policy automation (complexity in rule definition)
- SBOM generation (still maturing ecosystem)

### High Risk
- Full SLSA implementation (emerging standard, significant complexity)
- Automated remediation (potential for incorrect fixes)

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a measured approach to expanding security scanning capabilities. Phase 1 (govulncheck) provides solid foundation. Phase 2 additions should be triggered by specific needs rather than implemented speculatively. The decision framework ensures expansion adds value without degrading developer experience.

**Recommendation**: Monitor Phase 1 performance for 6 months before implementing Phase 2 enhancements. Focus on metrics-driven decisions rather than feature accumulation.

# Implementation Plan: Automated Vulnerability Scanning in CI

## Architecture Decision Analysis

### Approach Evaluation

#### Approach 1: govulncheck Only (SELECTED)
**Philosophy Alignment**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Simplicity**: Uses Go's official tool, minimal configuration
- **Automation**: Single command, clear pass/fail
- **Maintainability**: Official Go tooling, stable API
- **Dependencies**: Zero external dependencies

**Pros**:
- Official Go security tool from Google
- Zero external dependencies or accounts
- Simple, focused scope (Go vulnerabilities only)
- Fast execution (~30 seconds typical)
- Clear, actionable output
- Well-maintained by Go team

**Cons**:
- Limited to Go language vulnerabilities
- Doesn't scan container images or system dependencies
- May miss some dependency chain vulnerabilities

#### Approach 2: govulncheck + GitHub Dependency Scanning
**Philosophy Alignment**: ⭐⭐⭐
- **Simplicity**: Moderate - two separate systems
- **Automation**: Good but requires coordination
- **Maintainability**: GitHub native but dual configuration

**Pros**:
- Broader coverage (Go + dependencies)
- Native GitHub integration
- No external services

**Cons**:
- More complex configuration
- Potential for conflicting results
- GitHub dependency scanning can be noisy

#### Approach 3: Third-party Security Suite (NOT RECOMMENDED)
**Philosophy Alignment**: ⭐⭐
- **Simplicity**: Poor - external dependencies, accounts
- **Automation**: Good but complex setup
- **Maintainability**: Depends on external service

**Rejected**: Violates "Minimize Moving Parts" and "Ship Good-Enough Software" tenets.

### Selected Architecture: govulncheck-First with Expansion Path

**Phase 1 (This Implementation)**: govulncheck only
**Phase 2 (Future)**: Add GitHub dependency scanning if needed
**Phase 3 (Future)**: Consider container scanning if containers are added

## Technical Implementation

### 1. CI Pipeline Integration

#### New Job Structure
```yaml
vulnerability-scan:
  name: Security Vulnerability Scan
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: lint  # Run after lint but parallel to test
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v5
      with:
        go-version: 'stable'
        cache: true
        cache-dependency-path: go.sum

    - name: Install govulncheck
      run: go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest

    - name: Run vulnerability scan
      run: |
        echo "Scanning for Go vulnerabilities..."
        govulncheck -json ./... > vuln-report.json

        # Also generate human-readable output
        govulncheck ./... > vuln-report.txt || VULN_EXIT_CODE=$?

        # Check if vulnerabilities were found
        if [ "${VULN_EXIT_CODE:-0}" -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "❌ CRITICAL: Vulnerabilities found in dependencies"
          echo "Full report:"
          cat vuln-report.txt
          exit 1
        else
          echo "✅ No known vulnerabilities found"
        fi
      timeout-minutes: 3

    - name: Upload vulnerability reports
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      if: always()  # Upload even if scan fails
      with:
        name: vulnerability-reports
        path: |
          vuln-report.json
          vuln-report.txt
        retention-days: 30
```

#### Integration Points
- **Position**: After lint, parallel to test (non-blocking for development velocity)
- **Failure Behavior**: Hard fail on any vulnerabilities (aligns with "no compromise" security stance)
- **Caching**: Use Go module cache for performance
- **Timeout**: 3 minutes (govulncheck is typically very fast)

### 2. Reporting Strategy

#### Artifact Structure
```
vulnerability-reports/
├── vuln-report.json    # Machine-readable for future automation
└── vuln-report.txt     # Human-readable for immediate review
```

#### Report Access
- **Developers**: View in GitHub Actions UI
- **CI/CD**: JSON format enables future automation
- **Security Team**: 30-day retention for audit trail

### 3. Failure Handling

#### Severity Threshold
- **FAIL**: Any vulnerability (govulncheck only reports actionable vulnerabilities)
- **Rationale**: govulncheck is conservative - if it reports something, it's worth fixing
- **Future**: Could add severity filtering if needed, but start strict

#### Error Scenarios
1. **Network failure**: Retry once, fail if persistent
2. **Tool installation failure**: Fail immediately (infrastructure issue)
3. **Scan timeout**: Fail (potential infinite loop in scanning)
4. **Vulnerabilities found**: Fail with detailed report

### 4. Performance Considerations

#### Optimization Strategy
- **Parallel Execution**: Run parallel to tests, not blocking development
- **Caching**: Leverage Go module cache
- **Minimal Scope**: Scan only Go code initially
- **Fast Feedback**: Target <3 minute execution time

#### Resource Usage
- **CPU**: Minimal (govulncheck is lightweight)
- **Network**: Downloads vulnerability database (cached by Go modules)
- **Storage**: <1MB for reports

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Core Vulnerability Scanning (30 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Add vulnerability scan job to .github/workflows/ci.yml
# 2. Position after lint job
# 3. Install govulncheck
# 4. Run basic scan with failure on any vulnerability
```

### Step 2: Enhanced Reporting (15 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Generate both JSON and text reports
# 2. Add artifact upload for reports
# 3. Improve error messages and output formatting
```

### Step 3: Integration Testing (15 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Test with clean codebase (should pass)
# 2. Test failure scenarios locally
# 3. Verify artifact generation
# 4. Confirm proper job dependencies
```

### Step 4: Documentation (10 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Update CLAUDE.md with vulnerability scanning info
# 2. Add comment to CI workflow for maintainability
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Layers

#### 1. Synthetic Vulnerability Testing
```bash
# Create test branch with known vulnerability
# Verify CI fails appropriately
# Test report generation and artifact upload
```

#### 2. Integration Testing
```bash
# Test in PR workflow
# Verify parallel execution with test job
# Confirm proper failure propagation
```

#### 3. Performance Testing
```bash
# Measure execution time on clean codebase
# Verify timeout behavior
# Test with module cache hit/miss scenarios
```

### Test Scenarios
1. **Clean scan** (no vulnerabilities) → CI passes
2. **Vulnerable dependency** → CI fails with detailed report
3. **Network issues** → CI fails gracefully
4. **Tool installation failure** → CI fails immediately
5. **Scan timeout** → CI fails with timeout message

## Security & Configuration

### Security Considerations
- **Tool Source**: Official Go tooling only (golang.org/x/vuln)
- **Permissions**: Read-only repository access
- **Secrets**: None required
- **Network**: HTTPS only to official Go module proxy

### Configuration Management
- **Tool Version**: Latest stable (go install @latest)
- **Update Strategy**: Automatic via go install
- **Fallback**: None needed (fail if unavailable)

### Access Control
- **Reports**: Available to repository contributors via artifacts
- **Failure Override**: Not permitted (security-critical)
- **Configuration**: Only via code review in CI workflow

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| **False Positives** | Medium | Low | govulncheck is conservative, manual review process |
| **Tool Unavailability** | High | Very Low | Official Go tool, stable infrastructure |
| **Performance Impact** | Low | Low | Parallel execution, 3-minute timeout |
| **Scan Bypass** | High | Very Low | Required CI check, no override mechanism |
| **Network Dependencies** | Medium | Low | Use Go module proxy, retry logic |

### Risk Mitigations

#### Operational Risks
- **Tool Updates**: Automatic via `@latest`, Go team maintains compatibility
- **Database Updates**: Automatic via Go module proxy
- **CI Performance**: Parallel execution, reasonable timeout

#### Security Risks
- **Vulnerability Database**: Sourced from official Go security team
- **Tool Integrity**: Downloaded from official golang.org
- **Report Security**: No sensitive data in vulnerability reports

## Logging & Observability

### Logging Strategy
```bash
# Clear, structured output for each phase:
# 1. "Installing govulncheck..."
# 2. "Scanning for Go vulnerabilities..."
# 3. "✅ No known vulnerabilities found" OR "❌ CRITICAL: Vulnerabilities found"
# 4. "Uploading vulnerability reports..."
```

### Monitoring Points
- **Execution Time**: Track scan duration
- **Failure Rate**: Monitor CI failure due to vulnerabilities
- **Report Size**: Monitor artifact size trends

### Alerting
- **CI Failures**: Standard GitHub Actions notifications
- **Report Artifacts**: Available for 30 days for analysis

## Expansion Path

### Phase 2: Enhanced Dependency Scanning
```yaml
# Future: Add GitHub dependency scanning
- name: Run GitHub dependency scan
  uses: github/dependency-review-action@v3
  with:
    fail-on-severity: 'high'
```

### Phase 3: Container Scanning (if containers added)
```yaml
# Future: If containers are added to project
- name: Scan container images
  run: |
    docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      aquasec/trivy image myimage:latest
```

## Open Questions

### Technical Decisions
1. **Q**: Should we scan on every commit or only on PRs?
   **A**: Every commit to master and all PRs (current CI pattern)

2. **Q**: What if govulncheck is unavailable?
   **A**: Fail the build - security scanning is mandatory

3. **Q**: Should we allow manual override for urgent fixes?
   **A**: No - maintain strict security posture

### Configuration Questions
1. **Q**: Should we exclude any packages from scanning?
   **A**: No - scan everything initially, adjust if needed

2. **Q**: How should we handle transitive dependency vulnerabilities?
   **A**: govulncheck handles this automatically

## Success Metrics

- [ ] **[Refactor]**: Enhance Error Handling and Logging Consistency (Refined T13, Original T38, T47, T74, T75, T81)
  - **Complexity**: Complex
  - **Rationale**: Critical for reliability, debugging, and operational excellence. Adheres to Development Philosophy on Consistent Error Handling (§8), Logging Strategy (§10), and Go Appendix §8 (Error Handling), §11 (Logging).

  - **Expected Outcome**: Parameter validation code is easier to understand and update.

- [ ] **[Refactor]**: Remove Redundant Comments & Simplify Shell Scripts (Original T82, T83)
  - **Complexity**: Simple
  - **Rationale**: Improves code readability, reduces documentation drift (Philosophy §7, §12.3), and enhances maintainability of build/CI scripts.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Code comments are focused on *why*, not *how*. Shell scripts in `scripts/` are simpler and easier to understand.

# Task Description

## Issue Details
**Issue #43**: [Enhance CI Pipeline with Mandatory Quality Gates (Foundation Requirement)](https://github.com/phrazzld/thinktank/issues/43)

## Overview
Enhance CI pipeline with mandatory, blocking quality gates to guarantee minimum code quality and security standards before code is merged or released.

## Requirements
- [ ] Mandatory lint checks block pipeline
- [ ] Format checks are enforced
- [ ] Unit tests must pass
- [ ] Integration tests must pass
- [ ] Coverage checks enforce minimum threshold
- [ ] Security scans block on vulnerabilities
- [ ] Build process must succeed

## Technical Context
The project currently has a CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) with most basic quality gates implemented:

**Current Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Lint checks (golangci-lint, go vet, go fmt)
- ✅ Security vulnerability scanning (govulncheck)
- ✅ Unit and integration tests with race detection
- ✅ Build verification
- ⚠️ Coverage threshold temporarily lowered to 64% (target: 90%)
- ⚠️ E2E tests have execution issues in CI
- ❌ Missing fail-fast enforcement
- ❌ Missing quality gate orchestration
- ❌ Missing performance regression detection

**Technical Considerations from Issue:**
- Design fail-fast pipeline stages
- Implement proper error reporting
- Consider parallel execution for performance
- Plan for exemption/override mechanisms if needed

## Related Issues
This is a critical/high priority foundational requirement that enables better quality control for the entire project.

## Dependencies
None - this can be implemented independently.

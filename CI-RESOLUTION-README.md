# PR #24 CI Resolution Guide

This guide explains how to resolve the CI failure in PR #24 "feat: implement automated semantic versioning".

## Understanding the Issue

PR #24 contains:
1. An invalid configuration parameter (`fromRef`) in the GitHub Action workflow
2. Historical commits that don't follow the conventional commits standard
3. Recent commits with formatting issues

The key insight is that the project has a **baseline validation policy** where only commits after May 18, 2025 (commit `1300e4d`) need to follow the conventional commits standard. However, the current CI configuration doesn't correctly implement this policy.

## Resolution Approach

We've provided three key files to assist with resolution:

1. **CI-FAILURE-SUMMARY.md** - Detailed analysis of the failure
2. **CI-RESOLUTION-PLAN.md** - Strategic plan to fix the issues
3. **scripts/fix-pr24-ci.sh** - Interactive script that implements the fixes

### Using the Resolution Script

The script will help you:
1. Fix the GitHub Actions workflow configuration
2. Optionally fix commit message formatting issues
3. Ensure baseline validation policy is properly documented
4. Provide text to update the PR description

To run the script:

```bash
cd /Users/phaedrus/Development/thinktank
git checkout feature/automated-semantic-versioning
./scripts/fix-pr24-ci.sh
```

Follow the interactive prompts to implement the necessary fixes.

### Manual Approach

If you prefer to implement the fixes manually:

1. **Fix workflow configuration**:
   - Edit `.github/workflows/release.yml`
   - Remove the `fromRef` parameter from the commit validation step
   - Add clear documentation about the baseline policy in comments and error messages

2. **Fix commit message formatting**:
   - Use `git commit --amend` for the most recent commit
   - Use `git rebase -i` for earlier commits with issues
   - Ensure commit messages follow the conventional format

3. **Document baseline policy**:
   - Ensure `docs/conventional-commits.md` clearly explains the baseline validation approach
   - Add a note that only commits after May 18, 2025 need to follow the standard

4. **Update PR description**:
   - Add a note explaining that the PR contains pre-baseline commits that don't follow the standard
   - Request reviewers to focus on commits after the baseline date

## Testing the Fix

After implementing the fixes:

1. Push the changes to the feature branch
2. Monitor the CI pipeline to verify it passes
3. If issues persist, review the GitHub Actions logs for specific errors

## Future Improvements

Once this PR is merged, we should:

1. Implement a custom script-based approach to properly validate only commits after the baseline
2. Consider forking and extending the commitlint GitHub Action to support baseline validation
3. Enhance pre-push hooks to prevent non-compliant commits from reaching the remote repository

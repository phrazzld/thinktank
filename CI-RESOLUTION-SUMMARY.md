## Key Insights

1. **Root Cause:**
   - Attempting to use the unsupported `fromRef` parameter with the `wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v5` action
   - Historical commits that predate the baseline validation policy don't comply with conventional commits format
   - Recent commits have formatting issues with body line length and footer spacing

2. **Approach:**
   - Remove the unsupported parameter and rely on documentation to explain the baseline policy
   - Fix formatting issues in recent commits to comply with standards
   - Document the baseline validation policy in code comments and documentation
   - Update PR description to set expectations for reviewers

3. **Long-term Solution:**
   - After merging PR #24, implement a technical solution for baseline-aware validation
   - Consider extending the GitHub Action or creating a custom script for validation
   - Enhance pre-push hooks to catch issues before they reach CI

## Next Steps

1. Execute the `fix-pr24-ci.sh` script on the feature branch
2. Push the changes to update the PR
3. Update the PR description with the provided text
4. Monitor CI to verify the fixes resolve the issues
5. After PR is merged, implement the technical improvements for baseline validation

## Expected Outcome

After implementing these fixes:
- CI pipeline will pass on PR #24
- Code reviewers will understand the baseline validation policy
- Future PRs will have clear guidance on commit message standards
- Foundation will be laid for a more robust technical solution
